# Tic-Tac-Toe

The below problems are to allow us a glimpse into your problem solving ability, style and current skill set. Please do problem 1, and optionally problem 2 or 3 depending on where you are most comfortable. We expect this test to take 2-3 hours, if you find yourself spending more than this do not aim to solve all 3 problems! We will not be judging based on number of problems completed only the style and thought process.

## Problems

### Problem 1

We have started a basic game of Tic-Tac-Toe as outlined [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) but we don't have anyone good enough to code to finish it!

- Please implement a complete basic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
- Please use React and TypeScript throughout, if you know TailwindCSS please expand on what is already provided, otherwise it is fine to use raw styling
- Both players will play out of the same application, it is sufficient to just switch the current player each time a move is played
- Once a game is completed, I should be able to start another game

### Problem 2

We are bored with the basic game now, can you make it so the board can be scaled to any size?

- Add some kind of input which allows me to change the board size
- The board size should be a number between 3 and 15

### Problem 3

We want to store game results in a database.

- create a simple backend server (using a simple generator provided by your IDE is fine)

- use any SQL/noSQL database to store the results
- return simple stats back to the front-end: number of win/losses for each player.

Simplification for the task:

- do not use database migration tools, just an SQL or other script to create tables is fine
- add comments about what you were thinking about but didnâ€™t implement because of restrictions
- host the project on your local machine, optional hosting in a public place is fine
- optionally create a Dockerfile to build both back-end and front-end. Do not create any deployment scripts, if it's not necessary.
- optional tests are welcome

## Quickstart

- Make sure you have **node** installed
- `cd client`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`

## How to build and start the project

- `touch server/.env`
- add the following 2 environmental variables:

```plaintext
DB_URL=mysql://[your-user-name]:[your-password]@localhost:3306/tic_tac_toe_game
SESSION_SECRET=4b0d432e400f09573de6c96b916ac6a3ae0ca6c3cfd83cb370b0152fc54dd845fc233b6381238e0981f1df97d189690c6dbc0afad59e5c46ed575cc64bf009dc
```

- paste the following SQL code into your **Database Client** of choice

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS tic_tac_toe_game;
USE tic_tac_toe_game;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS players (
  player_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  score INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  PRIMARY KEY (player_id)
);

INSERT INTO players (name) VALUES ('Nick');
INSERT INTO players (name) VALUES ('Catalin');
```

- `cd client && npm i`
- `npm run build`
- `cd ..`
- `cd server && npm i`
- `npm run start`
- [start-app](http://localhost:4000/) in your browser
- enjoy playing ðŸ˜€

## Testing the application

I built test for both frontend and backend

- run frontend tests: from the **client** directory run `npm run test`;
- run backend test: from the **server** directory run `npm run test`.

## Things that I would do if I had more time

- players' option to add their own name;
- before a new game starts the option for the players to chose if they want to use **X** or **O**;
- players to chose which one begins first on a new game;
- now we only have 2 players: **Nick** and **Catalin**; if we would have more players in the database, I will ask the players to select who they are from the list of all players. When I know who will play, I create an array with just those 2 players and use the same `moveNo % 2` logic to circulate between the players's turns.

### Testing

- mock the `PlayersTable` service so that I won't interact with the database directly;
- more testing on the diagonal extraction (i.e. on a 5x5 board and combine left to right and right to left diagonal extraction logic).

### Bugs

- after a player wins, there's a short 1.5-second delay before the board resets. If both players are about to win at the same timeâ€”like filling two rows or columns side by sideâ€”only one will be recognized first. But if you manage to click the last square in that small window of time, both players can win together!

### Development

- a shared types package between frontend and backend to enhance DRY code;
- loading UI spinner for async operations like fetch users or post user's score;
- right now, every time someone clicks on a square to place an **X** or **O**, I check if there's a winner. But this could be improved! Since it's impossible for anyone to win before making at least `boardSize - 1` moves, I could wait until then to start checking. That way, I avoid calling the more expensive `isWinner` function when there's no chance of a win yet.
